Younite is an application that was created to help combat the ongoing issue of police brutality.

Younite works towards creating more transparency in the system and discouraging officers from having unnecessary encounters with citizens, all the while allowing citizen's voices to be heard.

Although it may not be the solution, it was created with hopes of getting closer to a solution by:

  - Requiring that police officers create a report for every encounter they have with a citizen
  - Allowing the citizens involved to view the detailed report and
      - Make comments on how they felt they were treated during the incident.
      - Escalate a report to be further investigated by a third party
  - A less detailed report will be posted for the entire community to view, to offer transparency.
  - A citizen can also make comments on the community feelings board about how they feel the department has been performing as a whole.
  - The third party agency can view all of the reports that have been created, as well as the reports that have been escalated.
  - The third party agency has the ability to update the status on any escalated reports, as well as create new actions they have taken towards resolving the            escalation.
